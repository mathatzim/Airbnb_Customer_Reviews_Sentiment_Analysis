9,3 stars,May 2023,Apartment great. No issues. Location good. Very clean. We paid £250+ for a nights stay between 5 of us which is good value. However we was then asked to pay an additional £200 as a deposit which wasn’t stated and was request the day before check in. Happy days apartment the management company that run it then said we get deposit back after 30 working days. Absolute jokers so for that reason I’d avoid this and all of their properties when finding a place to stay.,P,N
28,1 star,November 2022,"Absolute nightmare: we awoke to drunk woman IN our bedroom, not the flat we booked, amenities not present on arrival, broken bed, LOUD.  The listing is extremely misleading. This is an entire building of holiday flats- a company. Pictures of the nicest flat are posted- the one we were checked into (flat # 5) looked nothing like what were were expecting. No toilet paper, paper towels,coffee maker/ coffee, salt or pepper in the flat at check-in (team was quick to bring paper items and instant coffee?). The small bed in that room is also broken, you sink right into a hole in the ""mattress.""Location: Extremely LOUD, might as well be sleeping in the bar and we were there from Monday-Wednesday. This is very understated in the listing. Unless you are going to be out until 3 every night when the music stops, it is impossible to sleep. None of the doors in the flat shut correctly (front door & bathroom). There also is not a way to lock the flat from inside.  We awoke to an extremely intoxicated woman hysterically crying IN OUR BEDROOM at 6:30 am. No idea how she managed to get into the flat but when we reported to hosts the first response was to place blame, ""How did she get into your apartment? The door must have been left open."" Thank you so much for first expressing concern.We checked out early immediately after. Worst airbnb experience so far and our experience could have been avoided with an accurate listing.",N,N
30,3 stars,October 2022,Its a clean and well maintained place with a very good fit out. But be aware that it is a central location in the middle of the night life and extremely noisy till the small hours.,P,P

49,1 star,June 2022,After paying for a night they then called me and asked for a £300 deposit. I said am the ad didn’t mention this and I am uncomfortable paying it. The woman was rude to me and that made me know be really nice towards her. I was then told I would get my money back and I have members ignored. This was 1month ago and they still ignore my messages. Don’t do book with me hem are they are really bad.,N,N
51,4 stars,May 2022,"Had a great stay at this Airbnb. Perfect location for night life on and around Mathew Street and the docks. Walking distance to everything. This does mean, as others have said, that it is a noisy location. Wasn’t an issue for us and not so much an issue if you’re there for the night life but if you’re hoping for an early night then you might want to bring ear plugs. Lots of amenities within apartment, and relatively clean. General apartment block was very quiet and smart. Also, as others have mentioned, the apartment in the photos isn’t necessarily the apartment you will end up with. Very strong weed smell right outside apartment in the hall way which at a point was so strong it smelt very much within our apartment while we were staying but that doesn’t mean it’s a regular thing and generally wasn’t an issue. Communication was brilliant and easy check in/out. We would definitely be very happy to rebook this apartment for future visits. Oh and the bed was extremely comfortable! Once again, the location is incredible, couldn’t of been better. Thank you all for a wonderful stay and a great apartment for continuing our ‘mini moon’.",P,P
53,4 stars,May 2022,Nice flat,P,P
60,3 stars,February 2022,"As others have said in other reviews the apartment shown in the first picture is not the one that we stayed in. Location was great, very central and close to everything. It is on a busy street, karaoke bars playing loud music till early hours. The flat itself was very basic, blinds in both the living room and bedroom let a lot of light in so bring eye masks. It had been cleaned but not very well, utensils were dirty, floors had not been hoovered and little pot for tea bags was empty. Communication was good prior to staying but afterwards had to keep contacting to get my deposit back.",N,N

66,1 star,November 2021,Absolutely awful stay hygiene was poor and the staff were unfriendly. Guys I recommend you don't stay here.,N,N
67,4 stars,November 2021,"The apartment is perfectly located, clean and perfect for a stay in Liverpool.",P,P
70,4 stars,October 2021,"Was not the room in the pictures, although it was fine enough for a couple of nights to crash.",N,P
72,4 stars,October 2021,Perfect location if your looking for a place to stay for a good weekend enjoying the bars and nightlife in Liverpool. The shops and bars are literally on your doorstep and the Irish karaoke in the bar downstairs is great fun. I would echo what others have said that probably not the place to stay at the weekend for families. But a weekend away with friends yes. Apartment is clean and has everything you would need.,P,P
76,4 stars,August 2021,"Clean, great location for a night out and Peter was very helpful and responded promptly to any messages.",P,P
81,4 stars,December 2024,Really central & a nice room. Quite. But if you like it very clean this is not the place for you…,P,P
88,4 stars,March 2024,"Have good experience, just some confused for the moments, but everything is all good thank you",P,P
91,3 stars,February 2023,Everything was okay it was a nice place and it had everything we needed. The only thing I could say it's that the bathroom upstairs wasn't really clean. We noticed a lot of lime in the mirrow (we couldn't even see ourselves on it) in the shower and in the sink. The rest of the apparment was good. Good quality price/place.,P,P

114,2 stars,January 2025,Internet coverage was bad ( only 1 to 2 bars network..mostly 1). Wifi provided was really weak . Water heater was not working well. Not enough anti slippery map.,N,N
124,4 stars,August 2024,"For the price that the host offers, there's nothing to fault. But from the photos, the territory looked more well-groomed  , a lot of things are hidden in  the corners, you can't see it in the photo. The discomfort did not deliver , but would look more aesthetic.There were towels, the shower works properly. The fan is inside. You can sit on the track as much as you like, the table on the track with the best view is reserved for room number 5.       I never met the host. Contactless check-in.",N,P
127,3 stars,June 2024,Atypical accommodation. The mattress is not very comfortable and the walls are very thin. The bedroom next door is located on the side as well as above it.Quite clean accommodation and great location to access all Granada on foot.,P,N
128,3 stars,June 2024,"Convenient location but bathroom to fix, I probably misinterpreted the images but the space in the room and bathroom is extremely small.",N,N
134,4 stars,April 2024,"Very friendly welcome and instruction. The roof terrace overlooking the Alhambra and the location in the Albaicin on the border with Sacromonte are top class! Everything is within walking distance.Unfortunately, the mattress was so saggy and inclined to the middle that you could not lie straight for two. Next time I would ask for another room/separate mattresses.",P,P
149,3 stars,September 2023,"We rented a junior room on the top floor of the building and an apartment,in the room my little one and I were staying in the room,and it was very very small, the tiny ""bathroom"", maybe enough for a guest, the shower had an old curtain and it should be changed,since the old mold stains do not give a feeling of cleanliness, it also doesn't help much since the water comes out when you showered,and maybe x that,there was a smell of humidity,especially when you closed the door and you came back in the afternoon.Two towels and one hand might not be enough,as one of the towels needed it to dry the floor and prevent the plastic from getting wet from the floor.In the apartment, it should be noted that you hear a lot of noise being on the street,however in the room it was very quiet, the only thing that when there are guests in the next room,you have to sleep when the others go to bed,and if they cook everything comes into your room,since it gives direct to the room.",P,N
150,2 stars,September 2023,"The price paid can work, although the description should be more comprehensive.When you arrive there is no way to stop to unload your luggage as it is a very narrow and one-way streetIn our room, I don't even have space to open your  luggageWith a few more directions, you would know how to organize yourself",P,N
156,4 stars,August 2023,We have been very comfortable in the accommodation.,N,P
157,4 stars,August 2023,"Accommodation close to historic center and alhembra , The room is small but beautiful terrace with beautiful viewsI recommend it",P,P
158,4 stars,July 2023,Location is best,P,P
159,3 stars,July 2023,"Upon arrival at the room we searched for listing opinions, in which many of the things we were observing were met. In turn, the host was responding that they were lies. In our humble opinion, acceptable for the location with terrace overlooking the generalife. After that, cleanliness leaves much to be desired: dirty shower, dirty shower tray, curtain with mold, hair on the pillow, and on the sheets.Regarding ventilation. Yes, there are two windows but 2 meters from the bed and with minimal ventilation. Paint smell like there's nothing more to arrive.Overall acceptable but we believe that the host could improve these aspects easily and we hope that for future visits it will improve because the experience with little effort improves a lot",P,N
163,4 stars,June 2023,"Nice place with a patio at the entrance and terrace. It's cool because it's out of the sun. Well located accommodation close to the historic center (15 minutes on foot), a bus to the Alhambra stops right in front of the accommodation.  Very difficult to park the car. I would recommend this accommodation for a few nights, a short stay. Jesùs was not present but text communication was effective.",P,P

191,4 stars,January 2023,"It is a small room, geographically comfortable for pomegranate. The large number of tours end at the Porta del Carmen.",P,P
192,1 star,December 2022,"Door very separate from the ground and very cold in, the stove was insufficient. The shower phone was broken, there were hairs in the shower, the towel rack was broken, smelled bad, and the floor needs fixes. Overall the state of conservation was terrible, it's not comfortable at all.",N,N
193,4 stars,December 2022,if you're traveling alone and want an experience it's definitely worth the money. but unfortunately with a kid it was too small for us. the host lady speaks only Spanish and is lovely. she'll try her best to communicate. the place could have been cleaner. and needs renovation. but otherwise the view and location is super awesome.,P,P
198,4 stars,November 2022,Close to everything. In a beautiful neighborhood. A little mountain walking but it's worth a visit. Very nice to be in a typical location in the area. Cute as all.,P,P
201,4 stars,October 2022,"Generally a nice stay, it was a pleasure being able to stay in Albaicin for this price. The room was small but good enough for a short stay (we only stayed 1 night). It was clean as well. The house was old but we didn't except anything different as we were searching for a true Albaicin experience. The matrace wasn't very comfortable. But all in all, it was good for the time we stayed.",P,P
206,4 stars,September 2022,"Essential room, suitable for short stays, great value for money.Quick and hassle-free check-in and checkout",P,P
209,4 stars,August 2022,"The room was practical and the place well located to walk around Albaicín and visit the Alhambra. Although we didn't meet Jesus, his mother received us and was very kind! :)",P,P
211,3 stars,August 2022,"Good value for money. Located in one of the most touristic parts of the city. Clean home. Check in and Check out simplified. Jesus responds quickly and with a lot of accuracy. On the other hand, it is complicated to access for those who are driven (for parking and street access).",P,P
215,4 stars,July 2022,Excellent location :),P,P
216,4 stars,July 2022,"good value, nice place, a tight room with a window as a part of the door is not too comfortable, no direct light but the terrace and patios are lovely!",P,P
222,4 stars,May 2022,"Site overlooking the Alhambra, directly next to the path towards Sacramonte and Mirador San Nicolás, with Ambiente de Albayzin, rustic and with beautiful patio. If you are looking for a typical place with a rustic atmosphere, this is it. The only thing that upsets is the bathroom because it smells a little bit like this next door, but for a few nights that's okay. You can make all of your feet. Very well located.",P,P

225,4 stars,April 2022,"The room was fine but the mattress was quite old , there was little hot water pressure in the shower and the WiFi connection it provided was very poor it worked very slow .The room is very cozy and has quite a bit of privacy .It has a common terrace at the top overlooking the Alhambra.The location  was perfect since it is very close to all the attractions .Very good communication with the owner is very good .",P,P

249,3 stars,October 2021,"The room is small and sloping, the shower throws water out due to a problem with the curtain too narrow, the wet floor slips and therefore you have to be very careful. For the rest, the location is magnificent and has a terrace where you can have breakfast looking at the Alhambra…",N,N
252,3 stars,September 2021,"A very small room, not very cozy and fairly dirty. It is very difficult to access by car to get to the house. The only good thing is price and position.",N,N

286,4 stars,April 2023,Well suited for a short stay. Oreste is a friendly and open host and always available for a conversation.,P,P
288,4 stars,April 2023,"Orestes is an exciting, cultured and available person. He is very respectful of his guests and you don't get bored if you want to talk. Let's also not forget the breakfast that Orestes prepare for his guests. The room itself is clean and well maintained but a recent water damage left one of the walls in a degraded state (Orestes had provided an electric heater and dehumidifier, but the smell of humidity persists. Once the work is done, it will be perfect.",P,P
290,4 stars,February 2023,"He's charming af, once we discovered that we all speak Spanish the place was more comfy for everyone, nice info about the neighborhood, how things kinda work there, where and no to go. He's a nice guy and you can talk with him about everything!Highly recommend if you want a cheap place near to the center!",P,P
296,3 stars,October 2022,"Oreste is a friendly and conversational host who even offers breakfast. The value for money could be better. Shortly after arrival, the room was vacuumed and the bathroom was cleaned. Unfortunately, it is clear that it is a smoking apartment. It is to be noted that the walls are quite thin, so both neighbors and sounds from the TV in the adjoining room can be heard.",N,N
298,4 stars,September 2022,"Oreste was a great host and did all he could to my make my stay as good as it could get! The house itself is older and showed its age a bit, but still it was clean and good for the purpose. The kitchen and bath are shared with Oreste and may smell like cigarette smoke - but not in the room though.I would recommend the host and accomodation! :)",P,P
301,3 stars,August 2022,"For the price you can't miss big. but clean is different. Oreste is very nice, though a little strange. As a woman, I would like to stay here because of the situation.",P,P
312,3 stars,June 2022,"Oreste is an awesome host. He's very kind and very flexible. He was kind and tried to make me feel comfortable... he even offered to make me breakfast. Unfortunately the place was quite dirty, it smelled like mold and smoke and this made my stay there quite uncomfortable. Nothing against Oreste because he was super kind and I appreciate his hospitality but the place was just a mess. If you don't mind a messy space you'll get an awesome deal and of course a nice host.",N,N
315,3 stars,May 2022,Great accommodation. Oreste is very good people.,P,P
318,3 stars,January 2020,"If you're not looking at cleanliness and you're looking for a cheap place to sleep, the place will work for you.As for Orestes, he is nice and welcoming.",N,P
319,4 stars,January 2020,"A welcoming, exciting, and ultra flexible host. The accommodation is really not far from the center of Brussels on foot, a very good value for money.",P,P
322,4 stars,September 2019,"The place is very basic, good for short-stay with a friendly host.  we had a nice time with Oresete. He also made breakfast for us, which was really good.       Overal,  we enjoyed our 2-night stay there.",P,P

328,4 stars,August 2019,"Overall staying at Oreste's was a pleasant experience. Oreste is very helpful and hospitable host. What's more, the apartment is relatively close to the city center.",P,P
330,3 stars,May 2019,"So here is my two cents on Oreste’s place. He’s a sweet heart of a guy, very friendly and nice. The place is just not up to my living standards. If you’re like me, and just want a cheap place to crash, then it’ll do for a night. The place is clearly in one of the lower socioeconomic areas of Brussels. Inside the apartment, it’s a bit gross. Did I find roaches and rats-no I did not, but there’s just something about the place that isn’t the cleanest, but again if you just want a cheap place then I guess it will do.Oreste is great. He made sure the bedding was clean, gave me a clean towe, and made me breakfast (scrambled eggs with cheese) and coffee. The breakfast was not good, but it was a kind gesture and free, so hard to complain. Just be prepared of what you’re walking into. It’s not a nice place, but it’ll do for one night if you’re traveling on a budget.",N,N
332,3 stars,May 2019,Oreste is very interesting and likes to talk with people he knew a lot about culture and language. He is very helpful for check in and check out time which helped us a lot. But to be honest the room is not clean enough. He smoked so there is some smoke smell in the house although he opened the window for the whole day we can still smell it. The  wll of the bedroom has mold and  some smell of moist. Considing the price it is ok.,P,N
336,4 stars,March 2019,"It is a very simple place, so it is perfect if you only need a place to rest in the night (just don't expect a 5 star Hotel). The host, Oreste, is caring and fun; he's very knowledgeable and this allows you having very entertaining conversations with him! He'll also prepare breakfast, which I really appreciated.",P,P
339,4 stars,February 2019,Oreste is a very funny guy!,P,P
340,3 stars,February 2019,"Was a nice stay. Oreste is so kind, he prepared a good breakfast, and he was very attentive. The location is near the center.",P,P
345,4 stars,June 2018,He can discuss any topic and gives a humurous touch,P,P
346,4 stars,June 2018,"Oreste was awesome, a great host. He was very hospitable and offered both breakfast and numerous tips on places to see. The only issue was that the BnB was in a bit of a sketchy area of town.",P,P

364,4 stars,December 2017,"Oreste is a very friendly, unique host who really cares about his guests! His place is about 20-30min walk to the centre of Brussels so we had no issues getting around by foot. The neighbours were intermittently loud until 10-11pm so if you are a light/ early sleeper we would suggest ear plugs. Through the night it was quiet and the bed was comfortable- much better than the pictures!",P,P

392,4 stars,February 2017,"Oreste is the most thoughtful and helpful host I have had on Airbnb. He wanted to make sure that I was okay with everything. I really do appreciate that. The only small con was that his place wreaked like cigarettes and I could not breathe. However, Oreste's kindness made up for it.",N,P
393,3 stars,January 2017,"The place was not difficult to find, but it's quite old and the room is on the second floor so if you have a big luggage is quite difficult. Another thing I was not comfortable was that the room you are staying and the toilet have not lock. Even though, the host is very helpful and kind, he offered me coffee, dinner and breakfast.",N,N

427,3 stars,July 2016,Oreste was friendly and always try to make me feel like home. :) Closed to centre and railway station. Neighbour was a little noise but it was fairly well for short term stay and price:D,P,P
435,3 stars,January 2016,"Oreste's apartment is nice and warm and located in a nice part of Brussels, with lots of grocery stores nearby. It's not far from tram station and in nearly 1h30m of walk from Atomium, 30m to the city center (Grand Place and others). The neighborhood was calm, nothing to afraid of.",N,P
439,3 stars,January 2016,Oreste has been a very good host. I have one friend who travel on last minute with me so it makes 3 of us to stay with him and hes flexible. He even prepare a good breakfast and cuppa coffee. Worth the price,P,P

463,1 star,October 2015,"We are a couple who stayed 2 nights in Oreste house, upon arrival I was waiting for us at the agreed time but the experience was not good. Lack of hygiene in general in the house and especially in the bathroom in general and especially in the bathroom. We do not use the kitchen for this reason.  On the first day we arrived from visiting the city at 23 h and I do not let us shower because I did not want us to make noise for the neighbors. He gave us some keys that the key to the portal didn't work and we depended on him being there to open us and we had to arrange arrival time so he was there to open and still we had to wait half an hour on the street. It is 20 minutes from the historic center and if you have a small budget more than one night I would not stay. Even so, good treatment and kind.",N,N
465,3 stars,October 2015,Staying with Oreste was a different experience. He is a talkative and unusual person but friendly nonetheless. He was kind enough to prepare me soup and coffee in the morning.,N,P
467,4 stars,September 2015,"Oreste is such a nice host, he tells you everything you need to know before you settle in. You can ask him anything and he'll be more than happy to help. I would love to stay in Brussels longer though, I would come again if I'm in Brussels really.",P,P
469,3 stars,September 2015,Welcoming host. He made me my first cup of Turkish coffee. He is nice to talk to.,P,P
473,4 stars,August 2015,"Oreste is a very friendly and helpful person, his welcome immediately makes you feel at ease. the apartment is small and modest, and if you don't have any particular pretensions, it's great to stay a couple of nights.",P,P
476,3 stars,August 2015,"grande Orestevery very kind and helpful. the house is very small and simple, if you don't have big pretensions it's fine. It is in the Arab neighborhood 2 metro stops from the grand place ... You really want a great Host",P,P

497,4 stars,April 2015,He is a bit weird in the beginning. Soon you will find him very funny and has a very good heart. You will be lucky to get to hear his life story too,P,P
499,3 stars,April 2015,The room was private and the bed was comfortable. The location was close to lots of tourist sites though the neighborhood felt unsafe at times. Next to a great Italian restaurant though that's open late.,N,P
505,3 stars,March 2015,Hii Mr Oreste. Thanks for the hospitality and warmness. You are a really great host! For 10 euro per night the place is nice but I would suggest to clean the place more and pls provide more comfy bed to the guest. Pls say hi to Simon and thanks once again.,N,P
509,3 stars,March 2015,"This is a very particular type of airbnb, and it is not for everyone. It is about 20 minutes away from the central station, but it isn't in the nicest part of the city. That flat itself is rather messy and does not feel very homey. It has the necessities, but not much more. Oreste smokes in the house, so the main living space smells of smoke, but he is considerate and will not smoke when you are present if it bothers you, and the room you'll stay in doesn't smell at all like smoke. There is no curtain in the shower and the hot water is extremely temperamental. The internet is great. Bring your own towels, as they are not provided, and you may wish to bring a nicer pillow too, as the one provided is a small couch pillow. Oreste asks that you make zero noise after 10pm, as the walls are paper thin. Some of the neighbors upstairs were pretty noisy, but it didn't bother me personally. I have stayed in many airbnbs, and this is one of the only ones in wish I never really felt at ease in the apartment.That said, Oreste is a really nice guy. He immediately offered me tea when I arrived and sat down and talked to me. He appreciates challenging philosophical and historical conversations, so you'll get along well with him if that's your thing. He also insisted that I eat breakfast in the mornings before heading out, and he offered me some very good homemade bread that he had just prepared. I can't say anything bad about Oreste as a host. He did everything I could of asked and him and was very kind. He is fluent in English and French (and potentially other languages, not sure).In the end, I don't think I'd recommend this apartment for anything more than a one or two night stay at maximum. There are much nicer places that you could stay in Brussels for not too terribly more expensive. 10€ a night is a great deal, but you are going to get what you pay for in terms of the flat. If you do not mind that, Oreste is a great host and I recommend him. Just be aware of what you are signing up for and be sure that it is what you want.",N,N

524,4 stars,December 2014,"Staying in Oreste's house was so pleasant especially when he did concern about my friend & I satisfaction while staying there. Besides, we were changing and shared alot of opinion regarding some issues. While staying in his house, I felt warmth because he was really help us and concern about us just like a family member. Moreover, the location is nearby to the city centre and metro station. Thus, Oreste even baked a delicious pizzas for us. The good thing of staying in his house is the warmth treatment from his to us as guests. I strongly recommend to others as they could try and experiences it by themselves.",P,P

538,4 stars,December 2023,"The place has really nice Parisian vibes. Checking in and out was pretty okay because it is no-contact. Although I don’t quite understand why do I need to clean after myself when I paid the cleaning fee:/Also the shower was small for me 😅 I had to wash my hair and my body separately. Also Wi-Fi doesn’t work at night which is really weird. And going to the bathroom is a bit cumbersome because you have to close the door each time and it’s not the easiest task. But overall, I really liked staying in the room ❤️The district is pretty clean and safe in comparison with other parts of Paris.",N,N

563,4 stars,October 2016,"I am here for seven days happily ever after. The host is very kind coffee every morning was good to drink.

And coffee pot and a microwave oven. But I'd like to come back again. Thank you.",P,P
564,4 stars,July 2016,"This charming little apartment is great - its in a good neighbourhood, near to a Metro and lots of excellent restaurants and cafes. The place is quiet and whilst small it is comfortable and very well equipped with everything you could need for a short stay. Frederic was an excellent host providing breakfast supplies for you to use, as well as useful advice on the neighbourhood, and I was a bit early and he was still able to meet me. If you are an older person the stairs to the apartment might be difficult but for me it was fine. The bed was very comfortable and the place is nicely decorated. I would recommend this place to friends as a place to stay in Paris.",P,P
571,4 stars,October 2015,"This is a lovely room in a trendy, exciting neighborhood (Oberkampf with all its bars and world-class restaurants). NB that it is a room, rather than a full apartment: the bathroom is outside in the hallway, and the host has built a mini-shower in the corner of the room. I wanted a pied-à-terre for the brief time I'd be in town, and this sixth-floor (seventh-floor if you're counting the floors American style) fit the bill accordingly. Frederic, the host, is a very kind guy who will answer all your questions. I didn't see much of him--I was so busy--but knew I could check in with him if needed. He can communicate easily in French and English, and is full of recommendations. Overall, a good neighborhood, a comfortable room, and a strong value.",P,P
577,4 stars,August 2020,"This was a cute Air BnB in a good area. Fred was very good at communicating! It is on the smaller side, even for a Parisian Studio, so would only be good for a few days. Thanks for the nice stay!",P,P
582,3 stars,October 2019,"The room is in a nice area and very central. As it says in the description, it is very tiny and has a small shower in the corner as well as a separate toilet. It is on the 6th floor with no elevator, so I wouldn't recommend it if you're bringing a heavy suitcase. There is not really any space to put luggage anyway. All in all it was tidy and matched the description, but I did find it a little overpriced.",N,N
583,4 stars,August 2019,"Frédéric was great at communicating, and quick to respond to any questions I had. One thing to note that wasn't clear to me is that while the shower is inside the room, the toilet is next door and is shared. Looking back at the photos, I think maybe I misunderstood and thought the full bathroom was back behind the curtain, but it is only the shower. Frédéric’s place is in a great area of Paris. I loved the cafes, restaurants and shops that were all just a short walk away. If you are solely looking for a basecamp to keep your things while you spend most of your time out exploring the city, I think this place is perfect for you!",P,P
585,1 star,June 2019,"The code that you first see in the check-in instructions should be ignored-it's inaccurate.. It is not made clear what Batiment means or where it is once you enter the building.. After you get to the 6th floor, there are 4 doors.. the key from the lock box fits into one door but doesn't turn... There is another of the 4 doors that says 'Fred' on it.. I didn't try that one because I wasn't wanting to enter Fred's apartment.. If you have trouble getting into the correct apartment, the host gives you many instructions but does not follow through and make sure you gain access into the apartment.. You need to go to a nearby cafe to get wifi to communicate with the host.. I got in after 5 1/2 hours because a man happened to come out of one of the 4 doors as I camped in the entryway..  He asked who I was and what I was doing there..  I said ""I live here"".. He asked if I was an Airbnb guest and then indicated the Airbnb apartment door I should go into.. If you have any issues with the host, he sends a long text about the 200 satisfied reviews he's had, the 4.5-5.0 rating he has and that he is an excellent property in a highly sought after location.. He never deals with your issues you've run into and indicates everyone else has no problems..",P,N

622,1 star,August 2020,"In the ad it was not stated that the toilet was broken before my arrival... noticed by the neighbor, since there was a common toilet. Toilet not repaired despite the host pretending otherwise, The host says their friend (not professional) has fixed the toilet. The host who says a plumber had to pass by 4 days before check-in and then claims that I broke the toilet. The host tells me to go to the bar downstairs (paying and closed at night) or throw a bucket in the toilet because they belong to the condominium. The host considers himself not responsible as he told me. We have to deal with a host who contradict each other, who has nothing to do with the people he rents to. Dishonest, don't even apologize for problems and don't mind making the customer feel like an idiot. In short, an investigation with AIRBNB's specialized service is under review and the member has been reported. Airbnb has already refunded me two nights despite the host's refusal. In any event, the dispute has been registered on the host's account to prevent other such behavior in the future. When we read the host's responses to bad reviews, it's curious to see that it's never their fault, but always the customer's response, so you can ask questions.  In conclusion, it is very expensive for deplorable service. It could still be a good time to have a quality host who shows humility. It's a long way from it.",P,N

659,1 star,March 2024,"I am writing this feedback to share my dreadful experience during my attempted stay at Grand Hostel Berlin. My experience was nothing short of a nightmare. I found myself waiting all night at the reception, trying to resolve a situation that had arisen, without any assistance from staff.The root of this issue began when I requested to change my reservation to one day later due to travel complications, a request that was promptly refused. When I finally arrived at Grand Hostel Berlin on the following day around 8 PM, hoping to check in, I was informed that my reservation was no longer valid because I had not arrived on the initially booked date, and thus, the remaining two days of my reservation were also invalidated. I was advised to wait for the manager, but after more than 4 hours of waiting, the manager stated they could not assist me as it is their policy to cancel the booking if the guest does not arrive on the first day of reservation.",N,N
666,2 stars,August 2023,"My stay at the Grand Hostel Berlin was a mixed bag. I would like to start with the hospitality. Staff were responsive, nice and helpful. When checking in it was quick and they dealt with everything excellently. The service I received especially at the bar was excellent! However the hostel was overbooked resulting in me loosing my initial room as I was moved to a new room. When I finally observed the rooms they were nothing like the pictures. They are single beds, with no privacy in dusty rooms. The toilets were terrible, the showers were on a 1 - 2 minute timer and there was only one toilet per floor. The prices for drinks and anything in general at the hostel is  excessive I would recommend you go elsewhere for drinks. The location is above average being so close to a metro. The price is nothing special and you could get better hostels in Berlin for the same price. The take away is +Great staff +Wonderful service- terrible rooms-booking mistakes-expensive",N,N

Then I thought I had to make sure I couldn't use that room in the first place.)Moreover, while eating with my boyfriend in the main room, there were cockroaches right next to the dining table, and I moved to the host's other accommodation around 2 am.",N,N
