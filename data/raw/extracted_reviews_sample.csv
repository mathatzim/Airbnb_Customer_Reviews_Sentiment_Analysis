3,4 stars,March 2024,The apartment was lovely and a great location however I had no check in instructions even once I arrived as the host hadn’t replied to me.
6,2 stars,June 2023,Not as advertised. Should stay 5 people but only one room with one double bed
8,4 stars,May 2023,"Love Liverpool, we went for our wedding anniversary, we did a treasure hunt which was good fun"
11,4 stars,April 2023,Great location!
24,4 stars,November 2022,"Right in the heart of the city! Great location for anyone looking to see the late night attractions of Liverpool, of which there are many.Easy to book, easy to access, and easy to get anywhere else with transport links to the wider Liverpool area.As some other users have said: the noise is definitely there. You’re right on Mathew Street so expect to hear the nightlife, especially at weekends."
30,3 stars,October 2022,Its a clean and well maintained place with a very good fit out. But be aware that it is a central location in the middle of the night life and extremely noisy till the small hours.
31,4 stars,October 2022,The Airbnb is located in the centre of everything it is a beautiful apartment
32,3 stars,October 2022,"My stay was okey. They took a lot of time to respond to my questions If you are searching for a quiet place, don’t come here"
34,3 stars,September 2022,"The host was approachable and flexible, but this place is incredibly noisy, with loud music from nearby bars going on well into the night. Not really an appropriate place to stay unless you're planning on going out yourself every night."
40,4 stars,August 2022,"Apartment not really like in the pictures, everything else pretty good"
50,1 star,June 2022,"!!AVOID!! Booked to stay at this property in Liverpool for an overnight stay however this stay was never actually encountered. Having booked the property twice due to an error, I was able to cancel one of the reservations whilst still keeping the other through the reassurance of air bnb themselves. When it came to the actual day of the stay I had contacted the property regarding the possibility of an early check in. Despite providing proof that I still reserved and paid for the stay, Peter and his incompetent team disregarded all of the proof and said there was no reservation under my name on their system lol and there was nothing they could do even though I had the booking confirmation of the stay on my phone which was already paid for. So if you’re looking to get scammed and stranded in Liverpool, I would highly recommend properties under Peter and his team :)"
55,3 stars,April 2022,"If you are a very fit party animal who likes to bang the rocks together till 3am, this might be the place for you. Otherwise beware. Nice enough flat, interesting location, good communication. Shame lift was out of order."
56,4 stars,March 2022,"Good spot if you are staying for the night life, right around the corner from the Cavern and the other pubs. Close to food and shops, I recommend Casa Italia and Cosy Club. Our stay was comfortable and there was ample space for the two of us and new appliances. The unit could do with some fix ups like fresh paint."
61,4 stars,February 2022,We really enjoyed our stay. It was cozy!The perfect getaway with the nightlife of Liverpool at your doorstep.
64,2 stars,December 2021,"Would not stay again despite the excellent location. We paid a £100 deposit that we didn’t get back until a week later and only after chasing for it. They enforce the deposit but have no transparent process of the return or terms, which made the experience a bit paranoid overall. They ask for your bank information to return the deposit, which would’ve been a hassle for me to get while on a vacation abroad. I went through Airbnb’s resolution centre to request the money back and they did return it. The check-in was already stressful and on top they gave us the wrong code for the door. It’s a self check-in, not in-person. The flat we had wasn’t pictured in the listing so it came as a surprise, though there is one pic that appears similar, I imagine it’s your luck of the draw whether you get the nice lofty ones. The communication with the company was inconsistent but someone from the company reached out via WhatsApp and it felt better to have a direct line to a human. He was very helpful and a relief!The unit itself was comfortable and spacious though a bit worn down (scratched walls, broken blinds, lamp missing it’s lightbulb.. the shower drain also stank), but we were only there for a short stay.  We took note of state of the apartment because of the deposit.We were told there is a £50 charge to check out one hour later, and there was an option to leave your luggage at the Happy Days office on the other side of town if you have a late departure. It wasn’t worth it for us though. The location really is the draw, but there are plenty of nearby places we would try instead next time."
66,1 star,November 2021,Absolutely awful stay hygiene was poor and the staff were unfriendly. Guys I recommend you don't stay here.
67,4 stars,November 2021,"The apartment is perfectly located, clean and perfect for a stay in Liverpool."
68,4 stars,November 2021,Nice place in the heart of the city. Surrounding area is a bit loud
73,3 stars,August 2021,"A pleasant apartment in the heart of Liverpool’s nightlife area, very close to clubs, bars and shops. Due to this location, it is very noisy until late and then quite noisy from early in the morning.The pictures are also NOT the apartment we ended up with. It is not mentioned in the description that we could end up in a ‘similar apartment’. Though nice, the apartment we ended up in was not as nice as the pictures being advertised. The pictures clearly show a character-filled loft style apartment whereas we were put in a first floor white-washed apartment, directly in line with the streetlights. This was an issue as the blinds on the bedroom are very thin and let a lot of light in.However, the kitchen is very well furnished and would be great for an extended stay. The bathroom was very good and the beds comfy. If you are coming for the location and only using this as a base, it will serve you well."
77,4 stars,August 2021,"The best location; everything you need is at a walking distance from the flat because of how central it is. The flat itself was spacious, clean and well-equipped - great for the price!Two things to be aware of is that the flat advertised is not the flat you are guaranteed (although the flat we were given was lovely and very similar interior wise). Secondly, as mentioned in the listing, the street is pretty loud at night due to how central it is, so although this was not a problem for us, it is something to keep in mind."
78,3 stars,July 2021,"Amazing location but flat did not look like pictures. Made me doubt that ‘Peter and Joanna’ exist. However, not bad value for money. Bring coffee and tea as none is provided."
79,4 stars,June 2021,"Was very clean, good location and affordable price !!"
80,3 stars,3 weeks ago,"It was a good place to stay. In the room I was staying in the window didn’t lock and the shared bathroom on the top floor had mold and excessive lime scale, it didn’t feel like a clean showering environment. The room was also dusty. But other than that it was well located, had all the amenities and Athena was easy to communicate with."
82,4 stars,December 2024,"it was a very nice stay, very convenient to be close to public transport. Good room. Thank you very much"
85,3 stars,May 2024,"Positives: Good location in central London and close to a subway station.Moderately clean,Responsive HostNegatives: apartment that needs a good refresh (very damaged hardwood floors, putty on the walls, completely blackened kitchen ceiling, shower joints to be redone, very noisy bathroom ventilation that can be heard from the bedroom)The bed base is distorted (hole on one side) we did not sleep very wellit was also extremely hot in the room while we are in the spring.Poor value for the money"
87,4 stars,March 2024,"Easy check-in, easy transportation, affordable price."
97,3 stars,August 2022,"The bedroom and bed are clean and comfortable, common areas are clean but a little decadent. In particular, we had an electricity issue the morning of our departure. Other than that, the hosts are very nice and leave everything you need to cook."
98,4 stars,August 2022,easy & fast check-in and check-out
102,2 stars,May 2022,Everything good except cleanliness .
110,4 stars,October 2021,"Room that has everything you need, kitchen is well equipped, very central and good price for London standards. Host is very helpful and responds right away."
111,4 stars,2 weeks ago,"Great communication from Jesús, the location is very good- just ten minutes walking from the centre. We arrived at midnight but because of self check in with a lockbox that wasn't any issue.  The room is basic, doesn't have a real window and could do with a fresh paint but very good when you consider the price you are paying, especially for a bathroom included. Pastora allowed us to have the spare set of keys so that we could have a pair each and came to check up on us to check that everything was good. The terrace is with it's great views is a nice bonus.The only negative we found was the cleaning, the floor was a bit dirty, and although the sheets were clean we found some hairs in them. The bathroom shower curtain was full of black mould on the inside at the bottom, also the bath mat was tiny and could not absorb all the water- it could do with replacing. All in all a good place for few nights in the centre of Granada, especially if you are just planning to shower and sleep."
119,4 stars,September 2024,"- Jesus is friendly and responsive- if you are traveller and you only looking for a place to sleep this will be a good deal for you, but if you gonna spend time other than the sleeping time then I don’t think it wont be your best choice.- the roof is nice and you can see Alhambra (It might be also a good option if you don’t want sit in the room)- bathroom is clean and usable- the location is nice and you can walk around it to see beautiful sights."
121,4 stars,September 2024,"perfect location to visit Granada, spaces that are a little small but suitable for spending one or two nights. Clean and very characteristic."
134,4 stars,April 2024,"Very friendly welcome and instruction. The roof terrace overlooking the Alhambra and the location in the Albaicin on the border with Sacromonte are top class! Everything is within walking distance.Unfortunately, the mattress was so saggy and inclined to the middle that you could not lie straight for two. Next time I would ask for another room/separate mattresses."
138,4 stars,January 2024,"Simple but cozy accommodation, clean, well presented. A light should be implemented in the bathroom. The owner communicates quickly with the traveler, friendly staff. No problem"
140,4 stars,December 2023,"the place was smaller, but it was definitely enough for our short visit. Votes, kettles, soap, and mugs provided. Cute accommodations."
149,3 stars,September 2023,"We rented a junior room on the top floor of the building and an apartment,in the room my little one and I were staying in the room,and it was very very small, the tiny ""bathroom"", maybe enough for a guest, the shower had an old curtain and it should be changed,since the old mold stains do not give a feeling of cleanliness, it also doesn't help much since the water comes out when you showered,and maybe x that,there was a smell of humidity,especially when you closed the door and you came back in the afternoon.Two towels and one hand might not be enough,as one of the towels needed it to dry the floor and prevent the plastic from getting wet from the floor.In the apartment, it should be noted that you hear a lot of noise being on the street,however in the room it was very quiet, the only thing that when there are guests in the next room,you have to sleep when the others go to bed,and if they cook everything comes into your room,since it gives direct to the room."
156,4 stars,August 2023,We have been very comfortable in the accommodation.
169,2 stars,June 2023,"The room does not have a bathroom door, which made it very uncomfortable to use. Common areas are filled with dirt and have a heavy cigarette smell. There is no direct bus left in front of the airbnb. In fact, you have to walk a very steep slope to find the house. The floor of the room is not level and the shower is not working well - the water pressure is very bad. The WiFi was working very badly: it was barely connected and the internet signal and the phone reception was leaving constantly. I don't recommend it."
175,3 stars,April 2023,"Tiny bedroom, one curtain separates toilet bedroom"
193,4 stars,December 2022,if you're traveling alone and want an experience it's definitely worth the money. but unfortunately with a kid it was too small for us. the host lady speaks only Spanish and is lovely. she'll try her best to communicate. the place could have been cleaner. and needs renovation. but otherwise the view and location is super awesome.
197,4 stars,November 2022,"The stay was great, close to everything you need."
199,3 stars,November 2022,"The entrance is on the right, as is the lockbox. Pablo is very helpful."
200,4 stars,November 2022,"The Bedroom is located in a charming Andalusian house with its patio. Everything is clean and dust-free. Sure, the room is small and not very bright but it was enough for us to sleep there. The terrace allowed us to eat on the small table.The house is ideally located at the gates of the Sacromonte with right in front of the Rincòn del Chapiz where we had all our breakfasts at a more than correct price (good and hearty)."
205,4 stars,September 2022,"A really nice stay. Happy with the rooftop terrace, as well as private bathroom/toilet"
209,4 stars,August 2022,"The room was practical and the place well located to walk around Albaicín and visit the Alhambra. Although we didn't meet Jesus, his mother received us and was very kind! :)"
210,4 stars,August 2022,"It is quiet is well placed, but it is airy just through the window of the door that overlooks the landing"
211,3 stars,August 2022,"Good value for money. Located in one of the most touristic parts of the city. Clean home. Check in and Check out simplified. Jesus responds quickly and with a lot of accuracy. On the other hand, it is complicated to access for those who are driven (for parking and street access)."
212,4 stars,August 2022,Nice silent house in touristic area. Small bedroom with private bathroom. Access is done by separate part of the house. Also really chill balcony with cool view.
213,4 stars,August 2022,top
216,4 stars,July 2022,"good value, nice place, a tight room with a window as a part of the door is not too comfortable, no direct light but the terrace and patios are lovely!"
219,4 stars,June 2022,"Jesus' mother was very caring and pleasant. The house is very well located, nice, very simple and basic. A very nice shared terrace.  Good place for my one-night stay."
228,3 stars,March 2022,"The room is somewhat damp (I was hit by rainy days) has a heater and a small kettle (no cups/glasses).The bathroom is inside the same room. So when bathing, the room is equally wet.It is very well located, and easily accessible.The litter is comfortable, and has enough clothes so it doesn't get cold."
232,4 stars,February 2022,Unbeatable location and lovely house
240,3 stars,January 2022,very good location. It’s too cold staying in the room even though the heater is on.
245,4 stars,November 2021,"Very well located, moderately comfortable and poorly insulated, we were cold (there is a heater but it makes a lot of light because it heats up in the light). However, very good hosting and very good price given its location (everything is done on foot and that's great!)"
248,2 stars,October 2021,"You will have access to a bedroom with the very strict necessities: a bed, 2 towels, a sink, a shower, a coat rack, shower product and that's it. No windows on the outside. The shared terrace is not very pleasant and seems a little abandoned despite the partial view of the Alhambra.The room has no comfort. The exteriors are not very nice. It's in a pretty good location and inexpensive, these are the 2 perks. It's very cold in the room."
251,4 stars,September 2021,"Everything was fine, I only stayed 1 night, but for me the only uncomfortable thing is that the bathroom has no door and is in front of the bed. It is a nice, clean and well located place for those who want to walk the historic center of Granada."
255,3 stars,September 2021,"Charming house, just like the pictures . When we arrived , at 12:36 pm the reception was not very good on the part of the woman who was limoing . A little bitter He told us without being the best way he didn't get in until one , that he had to disinfect, and as is . Well, I don't disinfect if we find a bloody tampon underneath the bed. I wouldn't have said this if she had been nicer at the entrance. On the other hand, the situation is great . With a parking lot that's worth 15 on the day . It's a room for a short stay, I think ."
260,4 stars,January 2025,"Oreste is one of the friendliest people I've ever met, likes to chat and share amazing experiences. The breakfast he prepared for us (included in the price) was very convenient. Both check-in and check-out were flexible. The location of the apartment puzzled us a little at the beginning, but at the time of being there, you just have to be aware like anywhere else. Would stay again with Oreste definitely."
261,4 stars,September 2024,"We were very well received, everything we were offered was granted. A place very close to the center, however on the streets we didn't feel so safe.Our host made us aware of everything and showed us a great place to eat, he also provided a great omelette and good company."
266,3 stars,June 2024,"Oreste was friendly, helpful."
267,4 stars,June 2024,The accommodation is conveniently locatedOreste is very attentive and concerned about your stay being pleasant Highly recommended
291,4 stars,February 2023,"We arrived after the time we had said and there was no problem at all. The clarifications to arrive very clearly for anyone. Great host, very friendly and attentive."
292,4 stars,February 2023,"a whole character, very attentive, sociable, includes breakfast, I would recommend ordering the apartment in general at least when I have the visits,best regards!"
293,4 stars,February 2023,"Oreste was a very good attentive host, warm, with very good discussions and responsive to our needs. It makes us feel comfortable and at home. The apartment is near the center so walking distance is convenient. The room is clean, the common areas are a little less and I would have liked to have been notified for cockroaches in the kitchen. Other than that, very convenient for a short stay and good value for money."
297,4 stars,October 2022,"Oreste is a great host, he was very attentive when checking in and out and we didn't go during the morning. He served us very good scrambled egg Turkish coffee in the mornings and provided us with a few bottles of water. Very communicative and excellent conversation.The perfectly acclimatized apartment is shared living room-kitchen and bathroom with him where a little more cleaning was missing. The room was very nice, with sheets, blanket and towels for the guests, but you have to add that there were things from the owner in the room and the bed somewhat uncomfortable.The location is good, 25 minutes away from the main square and quiet neighborhood.Value would definitely recommend."
301,3 stars,August 2022,"For the price you can't miss big. but clean is different. Oreste is very nice, though a little strange. As a woman, I would like to stay here because of the situation."
303,4 stars,August 2022,Oreste is a great host! Nice place to stay for a short time. We would be happy to be back!
310,4 stars,July 2022,"This is a good value stay, cleaning and atmosphere isn't always the best but you get good value for the prize. Oreste is a good and accomodating host, who provides nice and personalised breakfast.Location is good and easily accessible from the inner city. Plenty of restaurants around the block are open until late.It is worth noting that Oreste is a smoker, so you should beforehand express wishes that he does not smoke indoors during your stay if this is something that bothers you. Oreste was very helpful and smoked outside the apartment building when we were inside. The apartment has good ventilation so any smells are quick to disappear and the smoke doesn't reach into the room for rent."
317,1 star,February 2020,I won't go back there. I prefer to have a hostel in a clean room for less. I don't recommend it.
320,4 stars,September 2019,"Good talk, good cook, a good place to spend the night."
324,4 stars,August 2019,"Oreste is a smart person, very friendly and helpful. Make a very good breakfast. The location 25 min from the historic center. It's better than what you see in photos. I recommend 100%"
330,3 stars,May 2019,"So here is my two cents on Oreste’s place. He’s a sweet heart of a guy, very friendly and nice. The place is just not up to my living standards. If you’re like me, and just want a cheap place to crash, then it’ll do for a night. The place is clearly in one of the lower socioeconomic areas of Brussels. Inside the apartment, it’s a bit gross. Did I find roaches and rats-no I did not, but there’s just something about the place that isn’t the cleanest, but again if you just want a cheap place then I guess it will do.Oreste is great. He made sure the bedding was clean, gave me a clean towe, and made me breakfast (scrambled eggs with cheese) and coffee. The breakfast was not good, but it was a kind gesture and free, so hard to complain. Just be prepared of what you’re walking into. It’s not a nice place, but it’ll do for one night if you’re traveling on a budget."
332,3 stars,May 2019,Oreste is very interesting and likes to talk with people he knew a lot about culture and language. He is very helpful for check in and check out time which helped us a lot. But to be honest the room is not clean enough. He smoked so there is some smoke smell in the house although he opened the window for the whole day we can still smell it. The  wll of the bedroom has mold and  some smell of moist. Considing the price it is ok.
337,4 stars,February 2019,"Room with space, oreste was friendly and helped us up with the bags. There is no elevator in the building and it smells like fish, but we were very welcome!"
339,4 stars,February 2019,Oreste is a very funny guy!
343,4 stars,November 2018,Oreste is a very friendly guy and very flexible with the check-in and check-out time. Price is very affordable.
347,4 stars,May 2018,"The place is a bit far from Beekkant and it’s closer to Ètangs Noirs. If you don’t have internet on your phone, it’s better to have a map or remember the address, especially when it’s night. The host is kind and funny. He knows about history and he is curious at culture. We have discussed a lot. He made a breakfast every morning and gave a private room with double bed! It’s really reasonable to stay for a few days!"
353,4 stars,March 2018,Oreste was a great host. Communicated very well with us and helped us find our way into the city! I would recommend him for a quick stop in Brussels. His breakfast was delicious and let us have a late check in.
356,4 stars,February 2018,"Great location, close to the city centre. Oreste is available to offer tips to his guests and answer any questions they may have. He let us check-in early and also made us breakfast before we left the next day! Highly recommend."
358,3 stars,February 2018,"Good experience, Oreste is a great host and talker. I recommend his place. Merci Oreste."
363,4 stars,December 2017,"A normal option, budgeted against the backdrop of Brussels prices. We spent one night, in the morning we fed a delicious breakfast. Upon arrival, tea"
364,4 stars,December 2017,"Oreste is a very friendly, unique host who really cares about his guests! His place is about 20-30min walk to the centre of Brussels so we had no issues getting around by foot. The neighbours were intermittently loud until 10-11pm so if you are a light/ early sleeper we would suggest ear plugs. Through the night it was quiet and the bed was comfortable- much better than the pictures!"
366,4 stars,December 2017,"The room is exactly the one in the photos, it's big and spacious. He sleeps great on that mattress and the pillows are comfortable. We had a great welcome from Oreste with whom we were able to chat a bit of very varied and interesting subjects:) I highly recommend this place!! It's about a 20-minute walk from downtown and really for the price it has... unbeatable!"
368,3 stars,November 2017,"The apartment is perfect when you stop in Brussels and you have to stay, it is close to the downtown area, which you access without a problem, Our Host stood out for the helpful and good character with its guests, It is a good price/Room ratio."
378,3 stars,September 2017,Cool
383,4 stars,August 2017,"Very welcoming host,  the apartment is quite close to the center."
395,4 stars,January 2017,"Our stay at Oreste's was fine. He's behaved like a true host. Upon arrival he invited us to dinner and we had diverse conversations. The room is fine, no noise, but a little messy. Otherwise, I would recommend to other future transports to be at Oreste's house"
397,4 stars,December 2016,Oreste is friendly. He cooked breakfast for me everyday and we even shared dinner together. The room was okay however the neighbourhood was a bit unsafe to walk alone at night provided the streets were dim and the shops closed early. Overall my stay at there was pleasant with this great hosr
399,3 stars,December 2016,"Oreste very friendly and nice, good for one night,if you are very demanding with cleanliness it is not the right place for you"
406,4 stars,October 2016,Thank you
412,3 stars,September 2016,"Oreste was very welcoming and accommodating. Asked about things he could do to make my stay more comfortable, gave me recommendations for sites to see provided tea, coffee, water and breakfast. Quite a value for the price! What was lacking in amenities should be expected from such a low price. I will say that if you are a solo female traveler and/or like to keep to yourself you may want to reconsider."
413,3 stars,September 2016,"The apartment is very close to the center, on foot about 20 min. Oriste (host) is very friendly and kind. All you have to do is ask and he will arrange everything. Very communicative. Made us breakfast. Met late at night. However, you should know that although the price is lower than the market price, you will have to sleep without a pillow(or rather a piece of sheet stuffed with a password) and under a blanket without a pillowcase. It is also worth paying attention to the area in which to find an apartment, it is better to read about it in advance."
418,4 stars,September 2016,Oreste was very nice and helpful host. He was making sure that we weren't hungry or thirsty. He made good breakfast :) It was nice to spend some time with him and we had good conversations. He gave us tips what we should see in Brussels.Apartment is okay and the bedroom is spacious with comfy bed. We got good night sleep even though the neighbourhood can be a little bit noisy from time to time. We can recommend this place and Oreste as a host. He even took our laundry to the laundry place! He is really taking care of his guests and the price is very good :)
423,4 stars,August 2016,It was ok :) thx Oreste for everything.
424,4 stars,August 2016,Oreste is a fantastic host. He made us feel welcome from the moment we entered the appartment.We also enjoyed the conversations we had.He nicely provided us with some breakfast and gave some tips on what to do in the city)Hope to see you again!
427,3 stars,July 2016,Oreste was friendly and always try to make me feel like home. :) Closed to centre and railway station. Neighbour was a little noise but it was fairly well for short term stay and price:D
430,4 stars,March 2016,"Oreste was very nice and welcoming. He always asked if we need anything and prepared us a breakfast. Place was OK, but we couldn't expected more for the money. It was situated in muslims neighbourhood, but we didn't have any problem with it."
434,3 stars,January 2016,We actually did not meet Oreste since he was away when we came. However he communicated promptly and left keys with his neighbour  so everything was ok. The room/flat is what you expect from the offer - fine enough to sleep and cook some food. The neighbourhood is nice and safe and really close to the centre by foot. Downstairs there is a great shop with fresh seafood and meat for very reasonable prices:)Thank you very much Oreste! We enjoyed...
440,4 stars,December 2015,"Orestes is a very warm and generous person, he welcomed us and was a good host. I recommend it for anyone who doesn't want to spend too much, and it's close on foot and by metro to the tourist center."
443,4 stars,December 2015,I stayd really well oreste is really gentle and lovely personIt is the right compromise for 10 euros :) what more do you want? Recommended for those who are curious about life
444,4 stars,December 2015,"The place was near the city center, you can walk. The room is small but cozy. The host is polite and hospitable, fed us."
446,2 stars,December 2015,"Good place and very close to downtown, it smells a little bad when going out for a butcher shop that is next door, but for the price it's great!"
448,4 stars,November 2015,"Oreste is a very intelligent, kind, and helpful person. The flat is well located and easy to reach. He provided me everything I needed and always asked if I wanted food :) Thanks again Oreste!!!"
449,4 stars,November 2015,"I really enjoyed my stay at Oreste's home, he was very carefully and it was a pleasure to talk with him like i do with a friend. He provided me everything I needed, even invited me to have breakfast together. The price is  really a bargain and if you look for a place to rest in the evening is the best location."
454,4 stars,November 2015,"Orestes is a thoughtful host and an atypical person. The neighborhood doesn't look good but the room has an excellent value.Thank you for welcoming me so warmly, for being such good company and for letting me see your world a little bit!"
457,3 stars,November 2015,"Everything went well, Oreste is very nice as a person and respectful. Thank you"
463,1 star,October 2015,"We are a couple who stayed 2 nights in Oreste house, upon arrival I was waiting for us at the agreed time but the experience was not good. Lack of hygiene in general in the house and especially in the bathroom in general and especially in the bathroom. We do not use the kitchen for this reason.  On the first day we arrived from visiting the city at 23 h and I do not let us shower because I did not want us to make noise for the neighbors. He gave us some keys that the key to the portal didn't work and we depended on him being there to open us and we had to arrange arrival time so he was there to open and still we had to wait half an hour on the street. It is 20 minutes from the historic center and if you have a small budget more than one night I would not stay. Even so, good treatment and kind."
466,4 stars,September 2015,"Oreste is a nice and polite person. I checked in very late and that was not problem for him. I was warmly welcome by him, although I had not opportunity to talk with him for a long time, he seemed very friendly. The room is nice, especially king size bed, which is good for solo travelers. Location is also good, 5 minutes to the nearest metro station, from which you easily get everywhere in Brussels. The price is also convenient, so I'd recommend everyone to stay at Oreste's place."
479,4 stars,July 2015,"Location is good, 5 minutes walk to metro station. To the center takes 30 minutes something. I didn't meet him personally, I heard that he doesn't live at this apt at the moment."
484,3 stars,June 2015,"Very kind person, the place is just like in the pic. 15 or 20 minute walk to the center"
486,4 stars,June 2015,"Oreste was a really kind and friendly guy. We came late at night and Oreste was up and he also gave us breakfast both mornings of our stay.The room is what's expected for €10 and we were happy to find somewhere so cheap. Its worth noting me and my friend (both females aged 19) didn't feel safe in the neighbourhood at night; there aren't any women out and some of the men were a bit threatening, so if staying just make sure you don't walk around too late if you're a woman on your own.Other than that a good, cheap stay :)"
487,4 stars,June 2015,The host is a kind and friendly person.
488,4 stars,June 2015,Oreste is so kind !! everything is good !!
498,3 stars,April 2015,"Hi Orestes, The stay was beautiful ,we had a good time,  it was nice,  helpful Really it was good trip. Thank you Oreste. I would recommend it."
508,4 stars,March 2015,"Orestes is a very nice man and tells me the moment that I arrived how to find his place. The room is clean with a large tv. I slept like an angel. The street is close to the metro. You can take the bus or walk 10 minutes to the metro station. There are also shops and we can take a bus to Rue Brabant. By metro, direct to the center of Brussels and is so fast. Downstairs, in the center,a lot to do! At Orestes, he can help us in the possible way: If you want to know something,it's good to ask because the host can't read what we want. He is kind and after asking, he is ready to help us! Don't forget to ask if you want to know,need something."
514,4 stars,February 2015,"Oreste was incredibly welcoming, we had a good time and a nice discussion together."
515,4 stars,February 2015,Oreste was welcoming. We had interesting conversations and he made us pizza!
526,3 stars,December 2014,"Oreste was most hospitable and made us feel at home right from the start. The poor guy gave us his bed and slept on the kitchen floor and refrained from smoking although he's a hardened smoker when he was told we didn't smoke. He also played the drum for us as a farewell gesture!!! However, the neighborhood is effectively the ""Hood"" i.e. a bit sketchy (or colorful), depending on how you see things and I would advise a low profile when arriving late at night."
530,4 stars,November 2024,"Very clear instructions to enter the room and the host is very responsive if you need anything. Room is small but cosy, though the shower is not the most effective lol. Great neighborhood.Overall, perfect for a single traveler looking for a few days in Paris !"
531,3 stars,May 2024,"The location is very nice, with many metro stations around. The room is small, but this is not a problem. The only sink, that one can use, is also in this small room and it is under a shelf, so one cannot even properly wash his face or brush his teeth. The shower is also extremely small and there is enough hot water for 3 min wash, so if you have long hair be prepared for a cold shower. It definitely doesn't cost the money the owner asks for it.Ah, I forgot to mention the toilet, which can't be locked and it is shared with a neighbour."
533,4 stars,September 2024,"The property is in a top location with numerous cafes and restaurants. Even though the room is small and you are not allowed to be too big for the shower cabin, it is very nicely furnished and cozy overall. Everything was very clean, the mattress very comfortable and the house is very quiet so you can sleep well at night."
536,4 stars,January 2024,this was a perfect little room for a solo traveller ! a great location with lots to do in the neighbourhood and easily accessible. Fredric was quick to respond and gave clear instructions :) i felt very cozy as there was lots of things provided . would recommend for a short stay & would come again! merci encore
538,4 stars,December 2023,"The place has really nice Parisian vibes. Checking in and out was pretty okay because it is no-contact. Although I don’t quite understand why do I need to clean after myself when I paid the cleaning fee:/Also the shower was small for me 😅 I had to wash my hair and my body separately. Also Wi-Fi doesn’t work at night which is really weird. And going to the bathroom is a bit cumbersome because you have to close the door each time and it’s not the easiest task. But overall, I really liked staying in the room ❤️The district is pretty clean and safe in comparison with other parts of Paris."
540,4 stars,July 2023,"Positive:nice appartment, good location, price was fine.Negative:mind 6th floor without lift. I found a communication style of the owner a bit specific. Just to give an example: a note ,,Do not eat on my bed,, is one of many how to use the toilet, shower etc. Wifi was not working one day. A toilet is outside of the apartment.Generally for one or two nights is fine."
542,3 stars,January 2024,He responded quickly and it was helpful! He put small Christmas gift on bed:) but the place was on 6th floor and without elevator. And getting inside was hard. But except for that everything was good !
546,2 stars,August 2022,"There are a couple things that I think should be mentioned explicitly in the listing:* The shower's usable space is 3×5 feet (90×150 cm) at the ground level, and 3x1.5 feet (90×45 cm) at the head level (look at the photos.  The taller you are, the more uncomfortable it is. If you're above 6'3"", taking a shower is gonna be a nightmare. * There's no shower holder, so you gotta hold it with one hand and wash yourself with the other one.* there are no outlets near the microwave, so every time you wanna use it you gotta take it out of the cupboard, put it on the ground,  plug it in, use it, unplug it, and put it back in again.* 6th floor and no elevator (~120-ish stairs).* The sink is blocked by a piece of wood, so you can't really shave or wash your face there (look at the photos).* the building is old and a bit smelly.I just feel the listing information was not accurate and complete enough. I'm adding these to make sure the others can see them before booking it."
548,1 star,May 2024,Price to review compared to the proposed space
549,4 stars,September 2023,"Frédéric was very kind and responded quickly to the need! Bedroom on the 6th floor, to be considered if you have no fitness, but it is done!!! Small nice room and close to several metro stations, easy to get around from the accommodation! Thank you Frédéric for the stay!!:)"
552,4 stars,April 2024,Good
558,4 stars,September 2019,"The apartment was clean, quiet and located in a great area in Paris. For a single traveller, this apartment was ideal as it had everything I needed. However, I would place an emphasis on the fact that this apartment is very small. The shower is small and quite cramped, and may be an issue for those who are particularly tall."
570,4 stars,March 2016,"The room is perfect when you travel alone. It has everything you need and is located in a very good area which is also close to the center of Paris. Fred is a good host, very nice and helpful. I would definatly book the room again and recommend it to others."
576,1 star,September 2021,"A lot of info is missing in the description. The room is tiny and the bathroom is located in public hallway. Shower is extremely inconvenient and it is impossible to use towel inside especially if you are tall. I still managed to do so and left the wood floor clean and dry.The host will bombard you with tones of instructions which i followed to the best of my abilities. Yet, i received a request for 20 euro for disinfection of supplementary items. On top of hefty cleaning fee for a room of 6 sq. m. I have made images of all corners of the room that proof i left it nice and clean (granted sheets have to be changed). Yet, it feels extremely frustrating that the host is now harassing me with extra fees for cleaning."
577,4 stars,August 2020,"This was a cute Air BnB in a good area. Fred was very good at communicating! It is on the smaller side, even for a Parisian Studio, so would only be good for a few days. Thanks for the nice stay!"
586,2 stars,January 2019,"The room was probably a storage closet that was converted into a tiny bedroom. It's very unpractical if you're going to spend a couple days in Paris. The place is extremely overpriced for the location, and basic necessities like extra toilet roll aren't provided. Cuttlery wasn't washed, and the sink (which only works for hot water) is under an unpractical table which makes it impossible to wash your face with. I also started to itch after sleeping in the bed. I would not recommend this place simply because I feel like it's a rip-off for unwitting tourists. The overall decor is nice in the photos on here, but that's it."
592,4 stars,July 2017,"Great location, room is just as tiny as advertised but very charming. Host was very communicative and had some great tips for the area. 6 floors without a lift is a bit of a climb, but you get used to it."
598,4 stars,February 2023,"Lovely place, good host"
600,4 stars,April 2022,"Good stay in this small accommodation. Sometimes you have to use ingenuity given the size of the room, but the main thing is there: in a good location, quiet, price. I do not recommend if you are tall."
602,4 stars,March 2018,It was an enjoyable experience The space is neat and compact. It was everything that I needed. The location was wonderful and the local community was positive and upbeat. Great vibes
611,4 stars,April 2016,Good little room. Very meticulously decorated. The space is small but it is cozy and makes for a cool memorable experience.
614,3 stars,April 2019,It was OK! I would say it corresponds to what it is announced
616,4 stars,March 2020,"Excellent value for money, like hospitality. Ideally located and sufficient to sleep alone. On the other hand, expect a very small place of 6 m2 where the essentials are present. Very quiet, and it's a plus in Paris, except for the noise from the toilet shared with the student of the neighboring studio."
617,4 stars,July 2019,Lovely cosy studio strategically located.Merci Frederic!
618,4 stars,July 2018,"A beautiful little room in a lovely area, Thanks fred!"
619,4 stars,August 2022,A cozy and pleasant small room. Thank you Frederick.
623,2 stars,August 2020,"The apartment is cute, but I had a lot of issues with the host during check-in and after checkout. i was waiting for him 40 min on the street in a 37 degree heat and he did not answer my messages and did not answer my calls .After the checkout sent me messages, they want to charge me an extra fee because the rug in front of the shower was wet!!!"
626,4 stars,November 2018,He was very quick to respond and accurate before check-in.One thing to say is that the shower will be gone soon.Great location and access.
627,2 stars,June 2017,"It's unfortunate that the photos are misleading. The place is VERY small, without a fridge, with the shower inside the room (minimum) and the bathroom outside. There are 6 floors per staircase, and it would be practical to know in advance. Anyway, I spent some time ""recalculating"" until I understood the place I had arrived at, but I would have preferred to know it sooner so I could decide"
630,1 star,July 2016,Overfull
631,4 stars,June 2016,"small room but everything is there, the neighborhood is nice and quiet, good amenities, good bedding, host available... small downside... the shower under a roof slope quite narrowbalance"
632,2 stars,January 2016,"Room was fine but very small, difficult to make your toilet. The 6th floor without elevator is also a problem. This was only mentioned later.Because he had to leave urgently, he asked me to take a taxi that he would pay back later, 10€ did not happen.He would also provide an organic breakfast on 12/31, didn't happen."
635,4 stars,February 2016,"Frédéric is a very nice host. The tiny room is certainly ""tiny"" but very cozy, and a very good one for a short trip to Paris. Special mention to the particularly comfortable bed."
645,4 stars,March 2019,Very cozy and friendly apartment. Lots of attention!!
653,1 star,November 2024,"It's not like the pictures. It's the worst. I asked the host to switch to the same room as the picture, but they said they booked this room and were unfriendly. The room had no privacy at all and it was all about having 7 beds in one room. Later, we will book somewhere else, even if we give more money."
665,1 star,September 2023,The place is not good and only
666,2 stars,August 2023,"My stay at the Grand Hostel Berlin was a mixed bag. I would like to start with the hospitality. Staff were responsive, nice and helpful. When checking in it was quick and they dealt with everything excellently. The service I received especially at the bar was excellent! However the hostel was overbooked resulting in me loosing my initial room as I was moved to a new room. When I finally observed the rooms they were nothing like the pictures. They are single beds, with no privacy in dusty rooms. The toilets were terrible, the showers were on a 1 - 2 minute timer and there was only one toilet per floor. The prices for drinks and anything in general at the hostel is  excessive I would recommend you go elsewhere for drinks. The location is above average being so close to a metro. The price is nothing special and you could get better hostels in Berlin for the same price. The take away is +Great staff +Wonderful service- terrible rooms-booking mistakes-expensive"
667,1 star,April 2023,"Dirty bathroom, lots of noise, you couldn't rest, you had to rent towels. Not worth it"
669,2 stars,February 2023,From the description I expected a rather high-end hostel which turned out to be a complete disaster. Old and dirty showers with cold water.  A guest waking everyone up aggressively loud at 1am because he wasn't able to check in as planned. Everything felt old such as the sofas in the common area that were all broken. Slow wifi as well. Altogether a very disappointing experience. One thing is sure - I will not return.
671,2 stars,December 2022,"The man at the reception was very sweet and helpful and supported us, the check-in was very flexible. However, the place wasn't even like the pictures. We were all so shocked, because of anteroom, mirror and bathroom... on the beds there was dust everywhere. the beds and furniture look very high quality in the pictures, in really unfortunately only poorly painted and cheap. When we came back in the evening, there was an older man who resembles a homeless person in a bed of ours... how did he get in? Safety issue? However, we were assisted by the front desk and he was referred out of the room and the bed directly newly covered."
685,1 star,September 2023,"This lousy, my Nintendo was stolen and they don't want to be held responsible."
689,1 star,August 2023,.
690,1 star,May 2023,"The photos do not reflect reality. Socializing and common living areas were not very pleasing to people. Even though there are people you can socialize with, you feel worthless in this place. I even got warnings about no smoking outside the door, but then I saw others smoking too. I did not find what I expected. Amsterdam is an inviting city, but this place is not. I suggest you don't set your expectations too high. It was an inhuman experience."
693,1 star,December 2021,"The room was really really small and I think the bathroom and the kitchen would never be cleaned, it was so dirty. I thought ok for 9€ per night it's ok but then he wants more money after I have gone. And for the price you can find much better room's."
694,1 star,November 2021,"ALERT!!!  Do not stay here, they will steal you and the host is not a responsible person. ALERT!!!!"
695,2 stars,June 2021,"This place is what you can expect for the price. The pool is not usable, it looks more like a pond.  The room is very warm without a window.  We were bitten by mosquitoes and other bugs the entire time we were there.  The common areas deserve to be renovated.Positive part : the young woman who runs the hostel is very kind and does everything possible to help"
704,2 stars,October 2024,"For the price, it's fine..."

718,1 star,May 2021,"Disrespectful person unorganized, I believe this is a fake account"
734,1 star,May 2024,"Host, Location, Check-In -- 👍😊❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌Cleanliness, Hygiene, Amenities --👎🤬We cancelled the apartment due to hygiene issues after check-in. Planned to stay closer to center but in Emergency had to book another expensive Apartment in urgent.. Don't Trust the hygiene here. Informed AirBNB too.if apartment could have been cleaned, you can stay."
738,2 stars,October 2024,"The place was well located near the airport, there is room to park in the door but there are two things that surprised us, the room smelled of stale, both the sheets and cover and blankets smelled not to have been washed, the bathroom towels were half dirty with stains , apart from the smells and what disturbed us the most is that it has 1 or 2 cats to which I have an allergy and at no time I saw in the description that I had cats, just that it was animal friendly and that I think needs to be specified because less bad that we only stayed one day."
742,1 star,August 2023,"The room was very trapped and was it was hot, we had trouble falling asleep.  There was a fan in the room but it didn't help very much."
743,1 star,July 2023,Pet smell
744,1 star,October 2022,"A very disappointing and uncomfortable experience! The room itself was ""ok"", despite the air quality (overwhelming air-freshners were used). The house itself appeared to be in a state of construction, and was accompanied by extremely strong chemical smells. I was not able to sleep in this environment. Not recommended!"
745,1 star,September 2022,"When I arrived to Maria’s place, I was informed via text that it was under renovation and she was not there. I didn’t feel comfortable staying there by myself although it was a nice and quiet neighborhood. It’s very close to the airport so it’s very convenient. However the heavy smell of animals was too much for me and I love animals and have pets myself. The room itself was tidy."
746,2 stars,December 2021,"The place was not clean, in fact it was noticeable that it had not been cleaned for days. In the sink there was hair, humans and animals, dust, and stains of daily use that have been embedded. We were unable to make use of the shower, due to the condition of the shower.The kitchen, the same, is the remains of food, oil, which were still there without anyone having deigned to remove it. Covid measurements, none. No disinfection, no mask. The house smelled like a mix of animal and damp. The blind in the room fell off, holding with a giant clip. The bed was more or less comfortable. And Ana is nice."
751,2 stars,September 2024,"the depa in general is well located has an amazing view the only flaws there were it was that there was a lot of noise from the tenants, upstairs there were women's hairs in the bathroom,already when we were lying there was an alacran on the bed when we turned on the light it went down from the bed we had to move it to be able to kill it I wrote to the host  and I sent photos of the alacran and only left me in view anything else I could never connect to the Wifi i always said wrong password, I also comment and they didn't resolve anything  and there was a lack of toilet paper and the pillows smelled very bad we had to put some t-shirts on for the smell to disappear!"
753,2 stars,March 2024,I had trouble accessing the site. Even by entering the code provided I was unable to access the key to enter and I gave up hosting.
756,1 star,October 2022,"They sell tranquility. Please, what peace of mind? From room neighbors he had puppies on the side of the thieves and thieves. On top of that, I think I heard that they were pooping and there they were squeaking and sniffing at the door of the room I was in. The rooms are not marked, I didn't find the little tab to put the key in and lock the room. There is no fan or air conditioner, so in order to avoid suffocation and leave breathing you need to leave the door open and you can hear all the music and scandal from the center. There is no hot water, I couldn't clean up as the hot water literally only lasted for 2 minutes, and I had to get out of the shower. Since there is no way to lock the door, I slept with the light on to see if I could get someone in, don't rest at all. I rented two on October 8th and 9th, I only lasted one. I leave at 8 am and get another place if I could bathe. Ugly place and not comfortable. Nothing recommended."
763,1 star,July 2022,of the most unpleasant place is not recommended at all
768,2 stars,November 2021,Ok
771,1 star,April 2020,Absolutely sickening smell. It made me very sick to my stomach. I had to sleep in my car in the driveway...
774,1 star,April 2019,"I satayed here for nearly 3 weeks, I got charged maybe 3 times for the cleanning and the floor was always dusty everywhere, my linen smelled bad, On my check out, I was gonna stay at the end for a few nights more, When I asked Sarah, the very first answer was, haven’t you checked out? I said yes I just leave my belongs over there, she answered not very happy about that. I didn’t like her answer at all,  stayed there for near 3 weeks i was going to extend and plus she got mad beacause I didn’t take out my things during this hours lap??? it is not a good actitud and I won’t stay here again."
777,2 stars,June 2018,"This air b&b could be great but the pictures are not honest there like a girl with great make up but she’s not that pretty when she takes it off. The best part was some of the other people who stayed, them dealing with the overall lack of cleanliness with you a being cool makes it easier to deal. Sara may only respond if half or more of the people staying there complains. The air conditioning dose not work and that’s something people have the right to know before the book a stay but it definitely not revealed until you are there. The house has great bones and could be a great stay but it’s clear the keep up is bare minimum at best. And to be honest you will never see Sarah she only acts like she is a essential part of the house but she basically lets the house run it self until too many complaints come her way. In conclusion you definitely get what you pay for or maybe less, the people may be cool, but if you don’t have plans for most of the day you better makes some because the house is not a nice spot to chill for one reason or another. But hey the internet is good and the community shelf has some good seasonings."
781,1 star,August 2024,"I had an extremely frustrating and unpleasant experience at this Airbnb. I got locked out of my room, and when I tried to contact the host for the lock code with the help of another guest, he was incredibly rude and unprofessional. Instead of offering any understanding or assistance, he told me to never call him again and suggested that I just wait outside if I got locked out again. While he did eventually provide the lock code, the way he handled the situation was unacceptable. I would never recommend this host to anyone. If you're looking for a stay where the host is courteous and responsive, look elsewhere. This experience was disappointing and stressful."
784,1 star,October 2022,"Worst experience with a host that I’ve ever had. I didn’t stay here. Jack was discriminatory and rude beyond measure and it felt unsafe to be in that situation so I found a different Airbnb. Someone earlier mentioned serial killer vibes and I def got those, too. Stay salt folks."
787,1 star,May 2022,Room is comfortable and definitely worth the price but I came in the summer and the A/C was absolutely horrible. Me and my partner barely slept and when we did we woke up sweaty and sticky .
788,1 star,March 2022,It’s cold in the winter time! Every time I woke up it was 🥶 so invest in a heater before coming it is vary clean but one restroom so I’m the morning if your in room 1-  6 or 5 I believe you will have a little wait for the restroom. But honestly vary clean if you park in the driveway leave space for the owner to come in.
793,1 star,May 2020,"Rotting fruit under bed. When we complained, he showed up and verbally threatened us, this place is trash."
796,1 star,September 2019,I was accused of stealing. I am not a thief

800,2 stars,December 2017,"The house needs to be actually clean every day just not the beds an bed sheets , house needs to be swept every day an carpets need to be vacuumed everything was filthy , showers had black dirt stains from never actually cleaning an scrubbing showers, showers where very filthy, showers would not drain right so you would have to wait on the water to drain from the previous person before jumping in the shower, restrooms had hair all over the floors, sinks and counter tops had toothpaste stains and hair all over, 1st Airbnb and most likely my last , I figured I would save money by using Airbnb but I would rather spend the extra on a hotel then stay in a dirty home"
811,1 star,July 2023,"I couldn't go because I had the coronavirus 3 days ago, but they said they couldn't get a refund. The Air BnB policy is the same, and it's refundable up to 5 days before, so I think you should know well."
814,1 star,June 2021,"1. Be careful with a lot of cockroaches.It was serious to think that it was good value for money.I didn't see the review and booked it, but I even asked for cleanliness after checking it later.I started crawling in the bathroom at dawn.It came out of the refrigerator.I was glad I didn't choose to eat.Looking at the other people's reviews, it came out from the pot, but I don't think it's still managed to be this level.I made a reservation for two consecutive nights, but I came out to find a hotel where I could check in early after I spent money.. I couldn't even wash it here (crawling on the towel or even the shelf)The scissors are strong, so only go to those who can sleep with the wheels!2. Much older than the pictureNot only the wheel problem, but it feels much more worn and dirty.The wallpaper and moisture are all there. The bedding is old, and the laundry is still on the porch."
815,1 star,May 2021,It's dirty...The mattress is so dirty...The mattress goes out so well...
816,1 star,March 2021,"First, there was a bunch of dust and hair on the pillow in the small room, and there were stains on the duvet.However, I have prepared everything to eat and eat, and I understood that I was too tired to move, but it was clearly stated that there was oil, salt, pepper, etc. in the notice before booking, so I went without preparing it separately, but I didn't go without preparing it separately.I called and asked, but I was told that I couldn't help it because I couldn't get rid of it from the selection, because it was dangerous because I was eating, and I was told to buy it at a nearby convenience store and use it on my own.After that, I had to meet the host in person to talk to him, and after about 20 minutes, I was promised that we would pay after purchasing. (I also told you about the issue with the bedding, but this is not the main room, so you can't help it. Then I thought I had to make sure I couldn't use that room in the first place.)Moreover, while eating with my boyfriend in the main room, there were cockroaches right next to the dining table, and I moved to the host's other accommodation around 2 am."
821,2 stars,September 2023,The pool was not useable. The water smells horrible. You only have wifi at the pool. The location is really nice chilled but really near by the beach.
822,1 star,May 2023,"There were cockroaches in the shower, also a very bad smell comes from the water, not clean at all. The room is very hot, you can’t open the window because there is no net for the bugs and lizards. The pool is also smelly and dirty. Overall, the place is really dirty and unsanitary."
830,2 stars,April 2021,"The pool was quite dirty, very bad experience with cleanliness!!"
831,1 star,December 2020,"This place is far from cleanliness, security, and privacy. If it's for a family walk, I don't recommend it at all"
